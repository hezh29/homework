# Homework 07

## 1.

Program with machine language according to the following c.  
int_8 a = 1;  
int_8 c = a + 3;  
1）Write your assembly code & machine code  
2）Explain machine code execution with the fetch-decode-execute cycle  
3）Explain functions about IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU  
4）Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine

(1)  
LOD&nbsp;#1  
STO&nbsp;x  
LOD&nbsp;x  
ADD&nbsp;#3  
STO&nbsp;y  
HLT  
(2)  
首先，CPU通过储存PC中的值从内存中读取（fetch）指令，PC加1指向下一条指令，指令放到IR，中然后对IR中指令进行解码（decode）翻译为机械语言并传入ALU,在ALU中根据指令进行操作，并将结果暂时存入ACC中。一个周期结束。  
(3)  
IR：储存将要执行的指令  
PC：指向下一条将要读取的指令  
ACC：暂存操作结果  
(4)  
表示存储地址

## 2. 简答题

1）What are stored in memory?  
2）Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?  
3） Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.  

(1)  
Instruction and data  
(2)  
Yes  
(3)  
The instructions are made of two parts:instruction specifier and operand specifier.And the instruction specifier includes three parts: operation code,  register specifier and addressing-mode specifier.

For example  
|instruction specifier|instruction specifier|instruction specifier|operand specifier|  
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|  
|register specifier|addressing-mode specifier|operation code|operand specifie|  
|000|1|0000|00000000|  

## 3. 解释以下词汇

><dl>
><dt><strong>Assembly Language</strong></dt>
><dd>An assembly (or assembler) language,[1] often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.</dd>
><dt><strong>Compiler</strong></dt>
><dd>A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.[1] A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.</dd>
><dt><strong>Imperative programming</strong></dt>
><dd>In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates</dd>
><dt><strong>Functional programming</strong></dt>
><dd>In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations[1] instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x produces the same result f(x) each time; this is in contrast to procedures depending on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state. Eliminating side effects, i.e., changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.</dd>
><dt><strong>Procedural programming</strong></dt>
><dd>Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. </dd>
